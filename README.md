Security Hardened Container Images 


## Problem  
I as a user need container image that is hardended following established security hardening standard/framework. I as a user do not have the time nor experties to harden a container image. 

## Solution
Harden container images following established hardening standards/frameworks and make them available. The goal of the project is two folds
- Harden mainstream base container images(ubuntu,alpine,debian,etc.)
- Script to harden container based on custom requirements(pick what you need)

## Roadmap
- Identify standards/frameworks
- Select an base container image to harden(Ubuntu/Debian)
- Harden and publish container image
- Expand to other base container images to harden
- Automation/Script to harden container based on custom requirements(pick what you need)
